# Python_sr595
Python script to run 4 x 7 segment LEDs
Allows displaying digits using 4 595 shift registers, 4 x 7 segment LEDs

NOTE: This script works with how I have my board soldered; unless by some miracle it also works with your setup, you will have to experiment with getting the correct digits.

This requires python and shiftpi ( https://github.com/mignev/shiftpi )
